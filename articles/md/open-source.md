# Open-Source keeps the world spinning

##### Introduction

### A personal experience
From when I started 3D to now, I have used a lot of open-source software. I like how accessible they are, their communities, and how approachable they are. Some people look down on open-source software, which I don't really understand. I think it's amazing that random people around the world contribute to projects that help others, all for free. I have always felt that the people that look down on open-source software see themselves as "too good" or "too professional" to use it. I think that is a very childish way of thinking about this sort of stuff.

Using open-source software has its downsides, of course. Like any software, open-source software can have bugs, and sometimes those bugs can be hard to fix. Sometimes the teams don't have the time and resources to fix bugs in a timely manner, or at all. But with open-source software, the community can help, the devs are approachable, the bugs are communicated, or you could even fix it yourself and for the community. With closed-source software, you are at the mercy of the company that makes it. If they decide to stop supporting it, or if they don't care about your issue, you are out of luck. The issue will just not get fixed.

I recently started running DumbPad on my NAS, which is an open-source self-host notepad web-app. I have been using it for about a month now, and it has been great. I have had zero issues with accessing my notes, and I can even access it on my phone when out of the house. I host all the files on my NAS, so I don't have to worry about my notes being stored on some random server somewhere. But, at some point, I ran into a minor annoyance. Something so small that if I had paid for it, I wouldn't even cared about. But since this was open-source software, I could just reach out to the devs and ask for a fix. It literally took me 2 minutes to find their contact information and send them a message. They responded within a couple hours and fixed the issue that same day.

When hearing people that use closed-source complain about major issues like instability and crashing, I never hear any of them say they reached out to the development team. Yet they still happily pay a premium (most of the time a subscription) for the software that they are so frustrated with. I just don't get it.

### Open-Source I use
I use a lot of open-source software daily, and I want to share them all with you. I'll update this article when I find new ones I use.

#### Blender
You already know this. I use Blender each and every day. I have been using it for 6 years now and I don't see myself using any other 3D software in the future. I have used Maya and Cinema 4D in the past, and while I liked Cinema 4D, I absolutely hated Maya. This is not an article where I rant about how bad Maya is, so I will just move on to why I choose Blender.

Blender has an amazing community. Everyone is super approachable and we all have the same love for the program. The devs are also super active and they actually listen. Since Blender is one of the biggest open-source projects out there, it has a lot of resources behind it. The Blender Foundation receives more and more donations each year, which significantly speeds up development. The Blender Foundation also has a lot of sponsors, like Epic Games, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and many more. This means that Blender is not going anywhere anytime soon.

I use Blender for anything 3D, motion graphics, logo design, image editing, and a lot more. I know some of these can be done easier in other software, but Blender is so versatile that I can do everything in one program. This makes it easier sometimes to just do it in Blender, since my mind is already wired for Blender.

#### Krita
Krita is an open-source painting program. I have been using Krita for about 7-8 years now? I started using it when I was making 2D games in Unity, and I needed a program to make pixel art. I had tried GIMP before, but I didn't like it. Krita was made for digital painting, so it has a lot of features that are useful for that.

Right now I use it mainly as an alternative to Photoshop, which it's not really but it works for what _I_ need to do.

#### Inkscape
Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor. I use it for making logos, icons, and other vector graphics. I only recently discovered it about a year and a half ago. I use it mainly for making SVGs from logos I make in Blender or Krita. I just make the logos in black and white, then import it to Inkscape to convert it to an SVG. Inkscape's tracing algorithm is really good, and it works really well for what I need it for. I have never really used it to create vector graphics from scratch, which I should probably try at some point.

#### MagicaVoxel

#### Jellyfin

#### Audacity

#### OBS Studio

#### Meshroom

#### DumbPad

#### Vaultwarden

#### Handbrake

### Honorable mentions

#### Davinci Resolve
It feels wrong to leave Resolve out of this list, even though it's not open-source. It has an amazing free version that is very powerful and that I have used for years. It is easy to learn and has never given me any issues, like I hear from other video editing software users. I upgraded to the paid version about a year and a half ago, and I have never regretted it. The paid features are worth it for me, but I feel for most people the free version is all they'll need. I have been using it for about 6 years now, when I started using Blender.
