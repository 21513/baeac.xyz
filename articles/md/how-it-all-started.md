### Who am I?

My name is Sem. I have never really talked about myself or my background, so in this article I will just explain who I am, how I got into 3D, and why I started making videos about it.

### What started it all
As a young kid I was always amazed by video games. I loved playing them, of course, but I was also fascinated by how they were made. When I got my first laptop, I started looking into how I could make my own games. I watched tutorials, DevLogs, and playthroughs of games.

At some point, I downloaded Unity and decided to try and make my own game. At first, I of course had no idea what I was doing, but it was fun. I watched a lot of Brackeys tutorials and for the first time coded in C#. All these games were 2D platformers that were never finished, but I learned a lot. I also made all the art in the games myself using Krita, which I had also just discovered. I made a lot of pixel art and I got pretty good at it (for my age at least). The 2D games got a little boring and restrictive so I looked for different things to do. At some point I discovered MagicaVoxel, which is a free voxel art software. It was basically just pixel art but in 3D for me, which was fun to play around with. MagicaVoxel is great for making voxel art and simple models, but at some point I wanted to make more complex models. The first software I found was Blender, of course.

I never watched the Blender Guru donut tutorial, which is what most people did when starting out with Blender. I just opened it and started learning it myself, which I quickly found out was impossible. When I opened Blender for the first time, I tried to rotate around the scene like I would do in MagicaVoxel, but the controls were very different. So, I went back to YouTube and watched a lot of tutorials. I never really copied tutorials 1:1, I always either watched them to learn and try, or watched them because I wanted to learn a specific thing.
